        <p class="section-description-long">
          People felt very strongly towards protecting their community and area. Their initial reaction was to cut commissions to prevent frequent flooding, but we told them that even with emission reduction, this is the prediction. We gathered and organised our insights from each activity into three categories: what worked, what didn’t work and ideas.

         The new design features a wheel with three sections: a plain map of the area, an annual flood prediction, and an annual flood prediction with severe emission cuts. <br> 
<br>
The minimal difference between the two flood predictions aims to highlight the inevitability of rising sea levels, prompting users to understand that the effects are unavoidable regardless of emission reductions.

        Through engaging the community in novel ways, we were able to have powerful conversations about what si facing the people at the heart of this issue.

The first rapid protofype activation allowed us to find what really matters to residents in coastal areas and what theyre perception and reative to the issue is.

Unlike an imperonsal way like the delivered mail thing we sent, A personal approach and a two sided conversation is an ideal way for people to engage with the conversation of climate change in their area.</p>
